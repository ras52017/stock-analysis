# VBA of Wall Street

## Overview of Project
- Steve wanted to perform an analysis on a larger dataset and also wants to find out how fast the VBA code will compile the results.

### Purpose
- To collect collect information on total daily volum and returns on different stocks for 2017 and 2018 and to determine if refactoring the code will make VBA script run faster.

## Analysis and Challenges
- To perform this analysis, I downloaded the pseudocode and saved the downloaded files. I added the script to the Microsoft Visual basic editor and editored the codes using comments provided. In performing this analysis, some challenges faced was was as a result of the code not running. I consulted the help assistance who helped me to debug the code after all attempts to get the debug done by myself.

  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- At the end of the stock analysis, I realised that the outcomes of the returns matched the the results of the initial assessment done AllStocksAnalysis1 on the dataset. 
 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- The challanges I encounted was writing the codes itself, debugging when I encounted errors and creating a logic for this analysis.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes
1. An observation was that the analysis after refactoring was faster for both years than the analysis for AllStocksAnalysis1. It took a total of 0.046875 seconds for the refactored analysis for 2018 and  0.04296875 seconds for 2017. These outcomes were both faster than the analysis completed for AllStocksAnalysis1 which run at 0.6210938 seconds for 2017 and 0.6328125 seconds for 2017.

2. Another observation is that within both analysis(AllStocksAnalysis1 and refractored), there was a slight difference in the time it took to complete each analysis when comparing 2017 1n

3. In general, the stocks did better in 2017 than in 2018 except for the Stock RUN which did better in 2018 than in 2017. Also, eventhough TERP did not do well in both years, it's performance were slighlty better in 2018 than that of 2017.



- What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

1. An advantage of refractoring code is that it runs faster as compared to non refractored code.
2. It can also be time consuming and the my attempt to debug led me from one error to the other.

- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

1. I spent a lot of time debugging and had to seek assistance from BCS learning assistance.
2. The refractored script run faster.
